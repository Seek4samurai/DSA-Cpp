<h2>1. Rotate by 90deg</h2>
<p>Transpose and reverse each Row.</p>

<h2>2. Rotate by -90deg</h2>
<p>Transpose and reverse each Column.</p>

<h2>3. Rotate by 180deg</h2>
<h3>There are two ways to do so.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Rotate by 90deg twice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Reverse each Row, then reverse each Column.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Rotate by -180deg</h2>
<h3>There are three ways to do so.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Rotate by -90deg twice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Reverse each Column, then reverse each row.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Rotate by 180deg, since both are same.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
